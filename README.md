# slic.js
Javascript implementation of the SLIC superpixel segmentation algorithm

# Purpose of this Project

This project is a practice project as I learn Javascript. Therefore, it's primary purpose is exploring, learning, and making something in Javascript.

# Background

The algorithm implemented here is based on the original SLIC algorithm, described at [http://ivrl.epfl.ch/research/superpixels](http://ivrl.epfl.ch/research/superpixels).
